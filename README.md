# StateInequalityDashboard
An exploratory dashboard in Tableau is used to allow the end-user to review the data for analytical purposes on a macro and micro level by region and state.  Statistics such as a Gini Coefficient of a subset population show us a single formulaic number of the degree of inequality in a distribution of wealth.  Combined with political measures such as individual and state government ideology based on regional population metrics, we will provide the end-user the tools to make inferences of how Americaâ€™s inequality (or lack thereof) has changed over time.
